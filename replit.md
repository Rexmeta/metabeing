# Overview

This project is an AI-powered role-playing training system designed to enhance communication skills for new employees. It uses interactive conversations with AI personas across various workplace scenarios, offering 10-turn dialogues, real-time emotion analysis, and detailed AI-generated feedback. The system supports text, text-to-speech (TTS), and real-time voice conversation modes. The business vision is to provide a scalable and effective tool for professional development, leveraging AI for personalized communication coaching.

# System Architecture

## Frontend
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript (Vite)
- **UI**: Radix UI with shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: Wouter
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Conversation Modes**:
    - **Text Input**: Standard text-based chat.
    - **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: User text input, AI voice response via ElevenLabs API, voice selection based on MBTI persona.
    - **Real-time Voice**: Full-duplex voice conversation via Gemini Live API, WebSocket streaming, server-side VAD, Web Audio API playback, barge-in support (turnSeq-based interruption handling).

## Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Language**: TypeScript (ES modules)
- **API Design**: RESTful for conversations and feedback, WebSocket for real-time voice.
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens) - JWT_SECRET 환경 변수 필수.
- **Authorization**: Resource ownership verification and role-based access control (admin, operator, user).
- **User Isolation**: All data queries filtered by authenticated user ID.
- **Security**: 
  - JWT_SECRET 필수 (미설정시 서버 시작 차단)
  - Cookie sameSite=strict로 CSRF 방지
  - API 키 로깅 금지
  - 로그인 Rate Limiting (5분 내 5회 실패 시 차단)
  - 비밀번호 복잡성 정책 (8자+대문자+소문자+숫자+특수문자)
  - 업로드 파일 인증 필수 + Path Traversal 방지
  - API 응답 로그에서 민감정보 자동 제거

## Data Storage
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM (PostgreSQL dialect)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon serverless)
- **Schema**: `conversations`, `feedbacks`, `users`, `categories`, `system_settings`, `ai_usage_logs` tables.

## Features
- **4-Level Difficulty System**: Users select difficulty, influencing AI responses across all conversation modes.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Comprehensive user conversation history analytics including scores, category breakdowns, growth tracking, and pattern recognition. Uses a ComOn Check research-based 5-point scoring system (converted to 0-100).
- **Real-time Emotion Analysis**: AI characters display emotions with visual indicators.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: `시스템관리자 (admin)`, `운영자 (operator)`, `일반유저 (user)` roles with distinct permissions for system admin, operator dashboard, and content management.
- **Category System**: Scenarios are organized by categories, with operators assigned to manage specific categories.
- **System Settings Management**: Configurable system parameters stored in `system_settings` table, including per-feature AI model selection (e.g., Gemini, OpenAI for conversation/feedback, Gemini Live for real-time voice).
- **AI Usage Tracking**: Logs AI API usage data (feature, model, token usage, cost) for cost analysis.
- **Configurable Difficulty Settings**: Difficulty levels are editable via the operator dashboard, allowing customization of name, description, response length, tone, pressure, feedback style, and constraints.
- **Intro Video Generation**: Integration with Gemini Veo 3.1 API for generating 8-second intro videos for scenarios, stored as WebM files.
- **Character Image Generation**: AI-generated profile and expression images for user-created characters.
    - Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash Image API for image generation.
    - Generates base portrait and 5 expression images (joy, sad, angry, surprise, curious).
    - Images stored at `/attached_assets/characters/{characterId}/{gender}/{emotion}.webp`.
    - Expression images displayed in chat based on AI emotion analysis response.
    - Supports gender (male/female) and MBTI-based visual traits.
